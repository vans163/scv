# scv
Erlang /w Elixir, automated distributed build system.



### Note

SCV uses inotify so it will only work on linux for now.  
You are free to push another backend such as fsevents for OSX.  
  
SCV is not fully tested yet, this will be removed when it has.  
  
SCV is not meant to be 99.9999% stable as it is a development tool.  
SCV is not meant to be used in production.
